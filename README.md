# LTM-App_Qt-interface

C++ application for detecting, recognizing and showing micro-expressions on a graphical interface. Qt, openCV and Dlib are necessary to run the app.

This part is only the Qt interface (no detection algorithm). 

Another interface is being implemented for OSX with Swift language, and the detection/recognition runs in an independent app.

This interface is based on the Qt videoplayer example.

Year-long project with Louis Lenief at CentraleSup√©lec (2018) and the Facial Analysis Synthesis and Tracking ([FAST](http://www.rennes.supelec.fr/ren/rd/fast/fast_accueil.php)) research team.
