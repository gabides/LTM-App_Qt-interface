# LTM-App_Qt-interface

C++ application for detecting, recognizing and showing micro-expressions on a graphical interface. Qt, openCV and Dlib are necessary to run the app.

This part is only the Qt interface (no detection algorithm). 

Another interface is being implemented for OSX with Swift language.

This interface is based on the Qt videoplayer example.
